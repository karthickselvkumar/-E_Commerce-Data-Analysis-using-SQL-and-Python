E-Commerce Data Analysis using Python & SQL
Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce customer and sales data to extract meaningful business insights.
Using Python and SQL, it explores purchase behavior, revenue trends, and discount impact to help improve marketing and pricing strategies.

Objectives;

-Analyze total revenue generated by different customer segments.

-Identify the relationship between discounts and purchase amount.

-Explore customer behavior (gender, location, frequency).

-Generate insights to boost campaign effectiveness and ROI.

Workflow

Data Collection: Imported customer and sales datasets into MySQL.

Data Cleaning: Removed missing values, standardized formats using Python.

SQL Analysis:

Total revenue by gender and region.

Effect of discounts on purchase amount.

Identified high-spending customers.

Python Visualization:

Bar, line, and pie charts for revenue trends.

Correlation heatmaps for variable relationships.

Insight Generation: Derived actionable insights to improve business decisions.

Sample SQL Queries
-- Total revenue generated by Male vs Female customers
SELECT gender, ROUND(SUM(purchase_amount), 2) AS total_revenue
FROM customer
GROUP BY gender
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- Customers who used a discount but spent above average
SELECT customer_id, purchase_amount
FROM customer
WHERE discount_applied = 'Yes'
AND purchase_amount > (SELECT AVG(purchase_amount) FROM customer);

Visualization Highlights

Revenue by Gender — Bar chart comparing total revenue.

Discount Impact on Sales — Box plot showing spending behavior.

Monthly Revenue Trend — Line chart showing seasonal variations.

Key Insights

Male customers contributed slightly higher total revenue.

Discounts boosted purchase frequency but lowered average order value.

A few high-value customers generated most of the total sales.

Seasonal patterns influenced sales performance significantly.

Results & Impact

Improved understanding of customer purchase patterns.

Helped design data-driven discount and marketing strategies.

Delivered a clear, interactive visualization dashboard.

Future Enhancements

Build a predictive model to forecast future sales.

Integrate dashboard into Power BI or Streamlit.

Automate SQL-to-Visualization pipeline.
